# MP1.5 - Dual-Axis Model Comparison

## Goal

Quantify dual-axis effects that are absent in single-axis models.

## Model families

- Bi-axis step geometries: `box`, `saw`
- Poly-axis-capable geometries in 2-axis setting: `island`, `checker`

## Deliverables

- Energetic decomposition vs single-axis baselines
- Strain localization comparisons
- Bader and DOS-family contrasts

## Checklist

- [ ] Select representative structures for box/saw/island/checker
- [ ] Normalize energetics consistently (area and line terms where needed)
- [ ] Produce core comparison figures
- [ ] Write conclusions on non-additivity and realism gap
